# Rock, Paper, Scissors
This is a project from The Odin Project that practices development from scratch. The first step was to design the game's functions using the console before creating the UI.

## Learning Outcomes
- Plan, plan, plan. 
I was able to get through the majority of the project with a mental plan but hit a roadblock when it came to writing the code to display the results and track the winner of 5 games. At that point, writing pseudocode on a whiteboard helped me break the problems down into smaller issues that could be tackled.

- Refactor when possible. 
Along with having a solid plan before coding, I would often realize I could refactor some code while coding instead of before or after coding. However, I believe this is part of the learning process as I also made sure to test and restore to a previous commit if the edit didn't work.

- It's the little things that matter.
This will come with practice and experience. I had an issue of an unreachable function nested in another function. The reason for this was because of the return command which exited out of the first function, thus making the nested function unreachable.

## Possible Next Steps
- Refactor more code
There's definitely areas that can be tidied up. I may come back to them as practice later, but for now will move onto the next TOP project.
